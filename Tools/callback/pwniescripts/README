PwnieScripts is a collection of simple bash scripts intended to simplify/automate the setup and use of the Pwnie Express plugs (http://pwnieexpress.com). The scripts are intended for use with, and have been tested on BackTrack 5. These could also be made to work on BackTrack 4 and other distros with very few changes.

Here is a list of each script and the functions it performs, in order of use:

- pwnsetup.sh: Automates the Pwnie Express setup process by enabling SSHD, generating SSH keys, creating a 'pwnplug' user, installing HTTPTunnel, generating an SSL certificate, configuring stunnel, and configuring DNS2TCP.

- pwnstart.sh: Kills any existing listeners, and then starts SSHD as well as new HTTPTunnel, stunnel (SSL tunnel), DNS2TCP (DNS tunnel) and ptunnel (ICMP tunnel) listeners.

- pwnwatch.sh: One-line script to monitor netstat for incoming connections from Pwnie Express.

- pwnconnect.sh: aka. the Lazy Script - initiates an SSH connection to the first available established connection from Pwnie Express, so you don't have to check which ones are active. It'll use the more secure/relible ones first (SSL, HTTP) where available. Use the -t flag to only connect over Tor.

- pwnstop.sh: Kills all existing HTTPTunnel, stunnel, DNS2TCP and ptunnel processses.

You may need to 'chmod a+x' these scripts for them to run.
